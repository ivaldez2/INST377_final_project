### Github Pages link: https://ivaldez2.github.io/INST377_final_project/

### Description
- The website can be used on either desktop or mobile browsers. My partner has a Macbook Pro and I use a Windows PC. Current chrome version: Version 113.0.5672.92 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- We used the Farmers Market API retrieved from Prince George's County Open Data. 
- The link to the API : https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/sphi-rwax.json
- The visualization that we included is the interactive map from leaflet.js.
- We used flexbox in CSS3.
- This website provides information about farmer markets in the county. The API we utilize incorporates various locations. Users can simply click on the "load" button on the "farmer market locator" page, followed by the "generate list" button, to obtain a list of farmer markets along with their opening dates and whether they offer meat, seafood, or poultry. Additionally, the interactive map allows users to visually locate these markets.
